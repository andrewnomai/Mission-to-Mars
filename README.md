# Mission-to-Mars

## OVERVIEW

Robin wants write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location so she can show it off to other astrohphiles, with the hopes of making it polished enough to gain the attention of NASA, where she wants to land a position at. She decides to create a web application that would scrape new data everytime she needs to. Using Python, MongoDB, and Flask, Robin is going to create a portfolio to showcase all her data as well as using Bootstrap to polish it up. 

##### DELIVERABLE 1 & 2
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we scraped full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then using Python and HTML, we added the code to update the Web App with the hemispheres images and the titles.
